# Getting Better at git

Git is a distributed version control system that was developed by the
Linux development community. The goals of the project focused on
developing a distributed model for revision control, ability to handle
large projects, support for non-linear development (e.g. thousands of
parallel branches), speed, and a simple design.

Most of the workflow on development projects revolve around the use of a
source code management system (SCM), and we use `git` as the tool of
choice. These exercises will help you get better at some of the basis.

## How to Play

* Fork the repo
* Read the first challenge (in `01.md`)
* All challenges assume that you are in the `demo/` folder.
* When you figure out how to complete it, make a commit detailing what
commands you ran. See the "Commit Format" section below for guidelines.
* Move on to `02.md`.
* Rinse and repeat.

## Commit Format
* First line: "Completing challenge N (COMMAND)."
* Second line: blank.
* Third-last lines: Detail the commands you ran, following the bulleted list in the challenge.

Follow the format Follow the format [here](http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html).

Sample:

```
    Finished challenge 1 (ls).

    * git init .
```

## More info

Each challenge builds on previous ones, and each one introduces only one new
concept. If you've mastered challenge N and you know how to use `man`, then you
can do challenge N+1.
